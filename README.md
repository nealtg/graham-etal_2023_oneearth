## Abstract
Traded agricultural goods redistribute water, virtually, around the world to satisfy unmet demands while limiting excess water extraction in importing regions. However, gaps remain in our understanding of how alternative international trade regimes may alter agricultural water demands, locally and virtually. Here, we explore global agricultural water savings and virtual water trade impacts of such trade regimes under reference and low-carbon scenarios using an integrated and water-constrained human-Earth system model. We find that varying agricultural market integration significantly alters regional water withdrawals, while also substantially impacting global nonrenewable groundwater withdrawals. These results highlight the susceptibility of water resources, across regions, to varying degrees of market integration. Understanding how trade integration may evolve in the future can assist in the integrated management of water resources to allow for enhanced food security and potential amelioration of water stress.

## The meta-repository markdown template
A sample meta-repository template is provided in this repository in the file `metarepo_template.md`.  

To use it, do the following:
1. Create the template repository as mentioned above in [Using the template](#using-the-template)
2. Clone your new repository to you local machine
3. Change directories into your new meta-repository directory you just cloned
4. Run `git rm README.md` to delete this file (`README.md`) and commit it using `git commit -m 'remove instructions'`
5. Rename `metarepo_template.md` as `README.md`
6. Run `git add README.md` to stage the new file that will show up on load in your remote GitHub repository
7. Run `git rm metarepo_template.md` to remove the original template
8. Run `git commit -m 'set up new template as readme'` to set the changes
9. Run `git push` to send the changes to your remote GitHub repository
10. Modify the `README.md` file to represent your experiement and use the `add`, `commit`, `push` workflow to update your remote repository
